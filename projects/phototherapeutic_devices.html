        <h4>Monte-Carlo Simulation-based Scattering Layer Design for Phototherapuetic Applications</h4>
        <p>
            Device that uses an array of LEDs of both UV and Red wavelengths is developed to address symptoms that are due to the lack of vitamin D synthesis. <br/>
            Scattering layer based on hollow nanoparticles are used to improve uniformity of light that reaches the epidermis. <br/>
            The scattering properties of the nanoparticles are calculated by the well-established Mie theory. <br/>
            Then, using the calculated values, the propagation of photons are simulated in a Monte-Carlo-based configuration. <br/>
            Almost every paramters including wavelength, LED profile and geometry, nanoparticle features can be tuned in the simulation model. <br/>
            Upon fabrication of scattering layers, the simulation model showed accurate prediction of diffusive patterns and transmitted power distribution. <br/>
            Currently, an in-vitro cellular test is being prepared, and the ultimate goal is to achieve safe, effective phototherapeutic device for vitamin D synthesis. <br/>
