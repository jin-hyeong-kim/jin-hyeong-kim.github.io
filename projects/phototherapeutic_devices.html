        <p>
            This page summarizes my work on phototherapeutic device engineering. The overall goal is to design 
            <strong>wearable/portable light-based therapeutic systems</strong> that deliver controlled spectral 
            power to the skin/retina while maintaining safety and comfort.

            <h3>Photon-Transport Simulation for Phototherapeutic Device Diffusion Layer</h3>
            <p>
                In this project, I develop a <strong>Monte Carlo-based photon-tracing simulation model</strong>
                to study light transport in the diffusion layer of wearable phototherapeutic devices. The 
                diffusion layer leverages hollow nanoparticles as engineered scatterers to 
                improve uniformity at the skin surface and mitigate local hot spots that could cause discomfort or adverse effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The simulation framework is grounded in Mie theory, which provide the scattering
                properties of the hollow nanoparticles embedded in a host medium. These optical properties 
                are then integrated into a Monte Carlo photon-transport model to:

                <li>predict spatial irradiance distributions at the device-skin interface,</li>
                <li>evaluate the impact of particle size, shell thickness, and concentration,</li>
                <li>optimize the diffusion layer design for both efficiency and safety.</li>

            <h3>Clinical Effect of Blue-Suppressed Light Source</h3>
            <p>
                This project aimed to show the physiological and psychological impact of 
                blue-suppressed light sources, motivated by concerns about circadian 
                disruption, stress, and sleep quality associated with conventional blue-rich lighting.
            </p>
            <p>
                A blue-suppressed light device with a tailored spectral 
                profile was designed to reduce short-wavelength emissions while maintaining sufficient visual 
                brightness and usability. Based on this hardware platform, I contributed in the 
                design of experimental protocol for clinical studies aimed at observing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>hormonal changes related to circadian and stress regulation,</li>
                <li>self-reported and physiological indicators of stress levels,</li>
                <li>objective and subjective measures of sleep quality.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By combining device engineering with clinical assessment, this work seeks to clarify how 
                spectral tuning can be used to create health-conscious lighting solutions
                that better align with human physiology while remaining practical for everyday use.
