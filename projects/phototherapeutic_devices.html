        <h4>Monte-Carlo Simulation-based Scattering Layer Design for Phototherapuetic Applications</h4>
        <p>
            Device that uses an array of LEDs of both UV and Red wavelengths is developed to address symptoms caused by the lack of vitamin D.
            Here, a scattering layer based on hollow nanoparticles are used to improve uniformity of light that reaches the epidermis.
            The scattering properties of the nanoparticles are calculated by the well-established Mie theory.
            Then, using the calculated values, the propagation of photons are tracked in a Monte Carlo method-based simulation.
            Almost every paramters including wavelength, LED profile and geometry, nanoparticle features can be tuned in the simulation model.
            Upon fabrication of scattering layers, the simulation model was proved to be able to accurately predict diffusive patterns and transmitted power distribution.
            Currently, an in-vitro cellular test is being prepared, and the ultimate goal is to achieve safe, effective phototherapeutic device for vitamin D synthesis.
