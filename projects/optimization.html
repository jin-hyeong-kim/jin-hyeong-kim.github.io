        <h4>Multi-objective Optimization Tool for Light Outcoupling Enhancement in OLEDs</h4>
        <p>
            MLA (Micro-lens Arrays) are one of the most common methods used to enhance OLED efficiency due to their effectiveness and planar integrity. <br/>
            Although hemisphere is the conventional choice for the unit lens structure, it is actually a sub-optimal solution. <br/>
            Running accurate optical simulations within a well-designed optimization framework can give the global optimum given the emission material. <br/>

            Here, the optimization of one or more desired OLED characteristics are defined as a 12-dimensional optimization problem. <br/>
            The problem was solved by algorithms based on GA (genetic algorithm) which returns the optimal lens structure and layer thicknesses. <br/>
            As a single-objective instance, EQE (external quantum efficiency) was maximized up to 62.7%. (+3% compared to hemispherical MLAs) <br/>

            </figure>
            The GA-based algorithm was slightly modified to be able to optimize multiple objectives at once. <br/>
            Pareto solution-based methods and penalty function-based algorithms were developed separately to serve this purpose. <br/>

        <h4>Bayesian Optimization for OLED Engineering</h4>
        <p>
            Optimizing complex systems such as the OLED+MLA often require more efficient methods than evolutionary algorithms. <br/>
            To this end, I have worked on applying Bayesian methods for high-dimensional optimization to design OLEDs with free-form lens structures. <br/>
            Bayesian optimization enables efficient exploration of complex, high-dimensional design spaces where traditional methods are costly or infeasible. <br/>
            Specific aspects of the OLED engineering problem had to be addressed for this framework to function properly and efficiently. (See <a href="./optimization.html#plc">k-NN-based Surrogate Model for Black-box Constrained Bayesian Optimization</a> for details) <br/>
            CE (current efficiency) was maximized up to +12% of hemispherical MLAs using this framework. <br/>
            The fabication of corresponding lens structure can be done utilizing a high-resolution printing techinque (2-photon polymerization)(2PP). <br/>

        <h4>k-NN-based Surrogate Model for Black-box Constrained Bayesian Optimization</h4>
        <p>
            One of the defined problem's features is that failing conditions for inputs are unknown. <br/>
            This is due to the underlying black-box geometric constraints within the Monte Carlo method-based optic simulation program LightTools<sup>TM</sup>. <br/>
            As a result, even input parameters that satisfy preliminary feasibility checks may ultimately fail during simulation, returning invalid outcomes. <br/>
            This characteristic situates the problem as a black-box constrained optimization, where the objective is an expensive-to-evaluate black-box function and the constraints are also analytically intractable. <br/>
            To address this challenge, we develop a k-NN-based surrogate model tailored for such settings. <br/>
            The surrogate not only approximates the objective but also accounts for uncertainty in feasibility by learning directly from observed outcomes. <br/>
            A warm-start initialization with well-distributed samples is employed to stabilize the surrogate training and ensure broad coverage of the design space during early optimization. <br/>
            By integrating these elements, this framework achieves efficient exploration while maintaining robustness against unknown and probabilistic constraint violations. <br/>

        <h4>Transformer-based Model for Prediction of Geometry Generation Failure in LightTools<sup>TM</sup></h4>
        <p>
            To provide an alternative way to address black-box geometric failure during the optical simulation process, I developed a transformer-based machine learning model that predicts when geometry generation in LightTools<sup>TM</sup> will fail, given a set of input coordinates. <br/>
            The model achieves over 95% accuracy, enabling researchers to avoid costly failed runs and focus computational resources on feasible designs. <br/>
            Model accuracy is continuously being enhanced through feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and systematic evaluation of transformer architectures. <br/>
            The incorporation of this predictive model not only accelerates Bayesian optimization for OLED engineering but also improves the robustness of simulation-driven design pipelines. <br/>

        <h4>Largely Fabricable Paraboloidal Lens for High-directional OLEDs</h4>
        <p>
            Optimized lens structure in the works regarding OLEDs can be hard and costly to fabricate for some unit lens structure. <br/>
            To tackle this, the Bayesian optimization framework was used to optimize unit lens structure in the design space of paraboloidal lenses. <br/>
            Optimized paraboloidal lens can show improvement in directionality. (objective function set as power transmitted within small angles from the normal direction) <br/>
            The corresponding lens can be easily fabricated in large-scale using 3D diffusion lithography. <br/>
