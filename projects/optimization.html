        <h4>Multi-objective Optimization Tool for Light Outcoupling Enhancement in OLEDs</h4>
        <p>
            MLA (Micro-lens Arrays) are one of the most common methods used to enhance OLED efficiency due to their effectiveness and planar integrity. <br/>
            Although hemisphere is the conventional choice for the unit lens structure, it is actually a sub-optimal solution. <br/>
            Running accurate optical simulations within a well-designed optimization framework can give the global optimum given the emission material. <br/>
            (picture of system)
            Here, the optimization of one or more desired OLED characteristics are defined as a 12-dimensional optimization problem. <br/>
            The problem was solved by algorithms based on GA (genetic algorithm) which returns the optimal lens structure and layer thicknesses. <br/>
            As a single-objective instance, EQE (external quantum efficiency) was maximized up to 62.7%. (+3% compared to hemispherical MLAs) <br/>
            (EQE figure)
            The GA-based algorithm was slightly modified to be able to optimize multiple objectives at once. <br/>
            Pareto solution-based methods and penalty function-based algorithms were developed separately to serve this purpose. <br/>

        <h4>Bayesian Optimization for OLED Engineering</h4>
        <p>
            Bayesian optimization which benefits by the use of ~~ is a fitting choice for optimizing complex systems such as the OLED+MLA mentioned in ''. <br/>
            Optimization framework for OLED engineering based on Bayesian methods drastically reduces computational cost required for optical simulations while maintaining high accuracy. <br/>
            Specific aspects of the OLED engineering problem had to be addressed for this framework to function properly and efficiently. (See '') <br/>
            CE (current efficiency) was maximized up to ~~ <br/>
            The fabication of corresponding lens structure can be done utilizing a high-resolution printing techinque (2-photon polymerization). <br/>
