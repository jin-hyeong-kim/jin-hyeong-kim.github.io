        <h2>Optimization of Complex Systems</h2>

        <p>
            This page describes my work on optimization of complex electronic and photonic systems,
            with a focus on <strong>OLED micro-lens arrays (MLAs)</strong> for light outcoupling enhancement.
            The design spaces involved are high-dimensional and expensive to evaluate, motivating the use
            of <strong>Bayesian optimization</strong> to search for globally optimal device structures.

            <h3>Failure-Aware Bayesian Optimization for OLED-MLA Design</h3>
            <p>
                Micro-lens arrays (MLAs) are widely used to enhance OLED light outcoupling due to their
                effectiveness and planar compatibility. Although hemispherical lenses are a conventional
                choice for MLA unit structures, they are often <strong>sub-optimal</strong> when the full
                design space is considered.
                <br><br>
                In this work, I formulate the MLA design problem as a high-dimensional
                Bayesian optimization task. The unit lens shape and key geometric parameters are
                parameterized in a 12-dimensional design space, and optical simulations are used to evaluate device performance 
                (e.g., external quantum efficiency and angular emission profiles). The goal is to identify MLA designs 
                that significantly outperform the hemispherical baseline while respecting fabrication and physical constraints.

            <p>
                To handle simulation failures and invalid geometries, I employ a
                <strong>failure-aware optimization framework</strong> that explicitly accounts for
                spline-generation failures in the optical design software. This allows the optimizer to
                focus evaluations on valid and promising regions of the design space, improving data-efficiency
                and robustness of the search.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using this framework, an OLED-MLA structure that achieves <strong>28% enhancement</strong> in current efficiency
                compared to conventional hemispherical MLAs were discovered.

            <h3>Multi-objective Optimization Tool for Light Outcoupling Enhancement in OLEDs</h3>
            <p>
                Prior to the work above, I developed a genetic-algorithm (GA)-based
                optimization tool to design OLED structures with enhanced light outcoupling.
                The algorithm jointly optimizes the MLA geometry and layer thicknesses in the device stack.
                <br><br>
                As a single-objective instance, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was maximized and
                achieved up to 62.7%, approximately <strong>+3%</strong> improvement compared to conventional hemispherical MLAs.
            </p>

                    Transmitted power versus viewing angle for the optimized lens structure compared
                    to a hemispherical lens.

            </figure>

            <p>
                The GA framework was further extended to handle multi-objective optimization,
                enabling simultaneous improvement of multiple performance metrics (e.g., EQE, angular
                uniformity, or viewing-angle constraints). I implemented both
                Pareto front-based methods and penalty function-based algorithms to generate trade-off solutions across conflicting objectives, providing
                designers with a spectrum of high-quality device configurations rather than a single point optimum.
