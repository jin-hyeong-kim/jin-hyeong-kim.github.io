    <h2>Optimization of Complex Systems</h2>
    <p>
        State-of-the-art electronic devices are typically complex in their structures and features.
        For example, typical OLEDs consist of more than 5 layers in which the number of layers, materials and thicknesses can all be tuned.
        When additional components such as outcoupling layers are introduced, the engineering of these systems becomes high-dimensional in terms of number of paramters we can control.
        Yet, most of these parameters must be considered properly to devise the most efficient, functional, task-appropriate system.
        My biggest research interest is creating methodologies to address a given optimization problem most adequetly and efficiently.
        In these works, different ML-based techniques, mainly Bayesian optimization, were integrated in order to achieve optimization of complex systems.
