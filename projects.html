    <h2>Optimization of Complex Systems</h2>
    <p>
        Modern electronic and photonic devices often exhibit highly complex structures. 
        Typical OLEDs, for example, contain multiple functional layers—each with tunable material choices and thicknesses—
        and may incorporate additional components such as light outcoupling structures.
        As these design spaces grow, the number of controllable parameters increases dramatically, 
        making the resulting optimization problems high-dimensional, expensive, and non-convex.
        <br/><br/>
        My research focuses on developing <strong>methodologies for data-efficient optimization</strong> 
        in such complex engineering systems. In the projects below, I integrate machine learning-based approaches to accelerate 
        the search for high-performance device designs while reducing computational cost.

    <h2>ML Works</h2>
    <p>
        My work in machine learning focuses on developing data-efficient models and training strategies that enhance the reliability of 
        scientific design pipelines. I explore <strong>transformer-based architectures</strong>, <strong>mixture-of-experts (MoE) models</strong>, and 
        <strong>reinforcement-learning-based data curation</strong> to improve prediction accuracy, reduce computational overhead, and support complex simulation-driven optimization tasks.

    <h2>Phototherapeutic Device Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        Wearable phototherapeutic devices provide a convenient and effective approach for treating conditions
        that respond to light exposure at specific wavelengths. Because these devices operate in close proximity
        to the epidermis, their optical output must be designed with great care to maximize therapeutic efficacy while preventing adverse effects.
        <br/><br/>
        My research in this area focuses on developing high-fidelity simulation tools that model photon transport in diffusion layers.
        These tools enable performance evaluation and safety validation prior to fabrication, reducing development cost and guiding optimal device design.
