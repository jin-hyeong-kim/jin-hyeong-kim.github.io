    <h2>Optimization of Complex Systems</h2>
    <p>
        State-of-the-art electronic devices are typically complex in their structures and features.
        For example, typical OLEDs consist of more than 5 layers in which the number of layers, materials and thicknesses can all be varied according to their functionalities.
        When additional components such as outcoupling layers are introduced, the engineering of these systems becomes high-dimensional in terms of number of controllable paramters.
        Most of these parameters must be considered properly to design the most efficient, functional, task-appropriate system. <br/>
        My biggest research interest is creating methodologies to address a given optimization problem most adequetly and efficiently.
        In the works listed below, different ML-based techniques, mainly Bayesian optimization, were integrated in order to achieve optimization of complex systems. <br/>

    <h2>Phototherapeutic Device Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        Wearable phototherapeutic devices can be an effective and convenient method to address symptoms or diseases that can be mitigated by light treatment of specific wavelengths.
        However, since the light source is placed very near the epidermis, the device must be designed carefully to avoid any side-effects. <br/>
        My research focus here is to develop accurate simulation tools that can evaluate the performance of the devices and validate its safety before production. <br/>
