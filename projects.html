    <h2>Optimization of Complex Systems</h2>
    <p>
        State-of-the-art electronic devices are typically complex in their structures and features.
        For example, typical OLEDs consist of more than 5 layers in which the number of layers, materials and thicknesses can all be tuned.
        When additional components such as outcoupling layers are introduced, the engineering of these systems becomes high-dimensional in terms of number of paramters we can control.
        Yet, most of these parameters must be considered properly to devise the most efficient, functional, task-appropriate system.
        My biggest research interest is creating methodologies to address a given optimization problem most adequetly and efficiently.
        In these works, different ML-based techniques, mainly Bayesian optimization, were integrated in order to achieve optimization of complex systems.

        <h4>Multi-objective Optimization Tool for Light Outcoupling Enhancement in OLEDs</h4>
        <p>
            MLA (Micro-lens Arrays) are one of the most common methods used to enhance OLED efficiency due to their effectiveness and planar integrity.
            Although hemisphere is the conventional choice for the unit lens structure, it is actually a sub-optimal solution.
            Running accurate optical simulations within a well-designed optimization framework can give the global optimum given the emission material.
            (picture of system)
            Here, the optimization of one or more desired OLED characteristics are defined as a 12-dimensional optimization problem.
            The problem was solved by algorithms based on GA (genetic algorithm) which returns the optimal lens structure and layer thicknesses.
            As a single-objective instance, EQE (external quantum efficiency) was maximized up to 62.7%. (+3% compared to hemispherical MLAs)
            (EQE figure)
            The GA-based algorithm was slightly modified to be able to optimize multiple objectives at once.
            Pareto solution-based methods and penalty function-based algorithms were developed separately to serve this purpose.

        <h4>Bayesian Optimization for OLED Engineering</h4>
        <p>
            Bayesian optimization which benefits by the use of ~~ is a fitting choice for optimizing complex systems such as the OLED+MLA mentioned in ''.
            Optimization framework for OLED engineering based on Bayesian methods drastically reduces computational cost required for optical simulations while maintaining high accuracy.
            Specific aspects of the OLED engineering problem had to be addressed for this framework to function properly and efficiently. (See '')
            CE (current efficiency) was maximized up to ~~
            The fabication of corresponding lens structure can be done utilizing a high-resolution printing techinque (2-photon polymerization).
