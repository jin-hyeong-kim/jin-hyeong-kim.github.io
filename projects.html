    <h2>Optimization of Complex Systems</h2>
    <p>
        State-of-the-art electronic devices are typically complex in their structures and features. <br/>
        For example, typical OLEDs consist of more than 5 layers in which the number of layers, materials and thicknesses can all be tuned. <br/>
        When additional components such as outcoupling layers are introduced, the engineering of these systems becomes high-dimensional in terms of number of paramters we can control. <br/>
        Yet, most of these parameters must be considered properly to devise the most efficient, functional, task-appropriate system. <br/>
        My biggest research interest is creating methodologies to address a given optimization problem most adequetly and efficiently. <br/>
        In these works, different ML-based techniques, mainly Bayesian optimization, were integrated in order to achieve optimization of complex systems. <br/>

    <h2>Phototherapeutic Device Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        Wearable phototherapeutic devices can be an effective and convenient method to address symptoms or diseases that can be mitigated by light of specific wavelengths. <br/>
        However, since the light source is placed very near the epidermis, the device must be designed carefully to avoid any side-effects. <br/>
        My research focus here is to develop accurate simulation tools that can evaluate the performance of the devices and validate its satisfication of safety criteria before fabrication. <br/>
