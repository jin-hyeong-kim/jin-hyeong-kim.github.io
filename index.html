        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I am a graduate student (M.S. candidate) in Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST.
            I am highly motivated to bridge machine learning and real-world engineering problems, especially by introducing carefully devised algorithms to optimize complex systems.
            To this end, I have worked on applying Bayesian methods for high-dimensional optimization to design for complex devices such as OLEDs with free-form lens structures.
            I also have strong background on (organic) electronics and material science, and experiences in OLED fabrication.
        </p>
        <p>
            I completed my B.S. degree in Department of Material Science & Engineering, KAIST.
            I am currently pursuing a M.S. degree under the supervision of Prof. Seunghyeup Yoo (EE, KAIST) and expect to graduate in Feb, 2026.
